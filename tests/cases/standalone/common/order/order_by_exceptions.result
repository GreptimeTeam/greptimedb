-- "order by -1" is generally an undefined behavior.
-- It's not supported in PostgreSQL 16, error "ORDER BY position -1 is not in select list".
-- But in Mysql 8, it can be executed, just the actual order is ignored.
-- In DataFusion, it behaves like Mysql 8. The "sort" plan node will be eliminated by the physical optimizer
-- "EnforceSorting" because it's sort key is parsed as a constant "-1".
-- We check the "explain" of the "order by -1" query to ensure that.
