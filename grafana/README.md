This cluster dashboard provides a comprehensive view of incoming requests, response statuses, and internal activities such as flush and compaction, with a layered structure from frontend to datanode. Designed with a focus on alert functionality, its primary aim is to highlight any anomalies in metrics, allowing users to quickly pinpoint the cause of errors.
