//! Version control of mito engine.

//! Version is an immutable snapshot of region's metadata.
//!
//! To read latest data from `VersionControl`, we should
//! 1. Acquire `Version` from `VersionControl`.
//! 2. Then acquire last sequence.
//!
//! Reason: data may be flushed/compacted and some data with old sequence may be removed
//! and became invisible between step 1 and 2, so need to acquire version at first.
