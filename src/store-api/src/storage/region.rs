//! Region holds chunks of rows stored in the storage engine, but does not require that
//! rows must have continuous primary key range, which is implementation sepecific.
//!
//! Regions support operations like PUT/DELETE/SCAN that most key-value stores provide.
//! However, unlike key-value store, data stored in region has data model like:
//!
//! ```text
//! colk-1, ..., colk-m, timestamp, version -> colv-1, ..., colv-n
//! ```
//!
//! The data model require each row
//! - has 0 ~ m key column
//! - **MUST** has a timestamp column
//! - has a version column
//! - has 0 ~ n value column
//!
//! Each row is identify by (value of key columns, timestamp, version), which forms
//! a row key. Note that the implementation may allow multiple rows have same row
//! key (like ClickHouse), which is useful is analytic scenario.
