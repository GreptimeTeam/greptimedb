Benchmarkers for GreptimeDB
--------------------------------

## Wal Benchmarker
The wal benchmarker serves to evaluate the performance of GreptimeDB's Write-Ahead Log (WAL) component. It meticulously assesses the read/write performance of the WAL under diverse workloads generated by the benchmarker. 


### How to use
To compile the benchmarker, navigate to the `greptimedb/benchmarks` directory and execute `cargo build --release`. Subsequently, you'll find the compiled target located at `greptimedb/target/release/wal_bench`.

The `./wal_bench -h` command reveals numerous arguments that the target accepts. Among these, a notable one is the `cfg-file` argument. By utilizing a configuration file in the TOML format, you can bypass the need to repeatedly specify cumbersome arguments.
