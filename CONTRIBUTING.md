## Your First Contribution

It can feel intimidating to contribute to a complex project, but it can also be exciting and fun. These general notes will help everyone participate in this communal activity.

- Follow the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- Small changes make huge differences. We will happily accept a PR making a single character change if it helps move forward. Don't wait to have everything working.
- Check the closed issues before opening your issue.
- Try to follow the existing style of the code.
- More importantly, when in doubt, ask away.

Pull requests are great, but we accept all kinds of other help if you like. Such as

- Write tutorials or blog posts. Blog, speak about, or create tutorials about one of GreptimeDB's many features. Mention [@greptime](https://twitter.com/greptime) on Twitter and email info@greptime.com so we can give pointers and tips and help you spread the word by promoting your content on Greptime communication channels.
- Improve the documentation. [Submit documentation](http://github.com/greptimeTeam/docs/) updates, enhancements, designs, or bug fixes, and fixing any spelling or grammar errors will be very much appreciated.
- Present at meetups and conferences about your GreptimeDB projects. Your unique challenges and successes in building things with GreptimeDB can provide great speaking material. We'd love to review your talk abstract, so get in touch with us if you'd like some help!
- Submit bug reports. To report a bug or a security issue, you can [open a new GitHub issue](https://github.com/GrepTimeTeam/greptimedb/issues/new).
- Speak up feature requests. Send feedback is a great way for us to understand your different use cases of GreptimeDB better. If you want to share your experience with GreptimeDB, or if you want to discuss any ideas, you can start a discussion on [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb/discussions), chat with the Greptime team on [Slack](https://greptime.com/slack), or you can tweet [@greptime](https://twitter.com/greptime) on Twitter.

## Code of Conduct

Also, there are things that we are not looking for because they don't match the goals of the product or benefit the community. Please read [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md); we hope everyone can keep good manners and become an honored member.

## License

GreptimeDB uses the [Apache 2.0 license](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb/blob/master/LICENSE) to strike a balance between open contributions and allowing you to use the software however you want.

## Getting Started

### Submitting Issues

- Check if an issue already exists. Before filing an issue report, see whether it's already covered. Use the search bar and check out existing issues.
- File an issue:
  - To report a bug, a security issue, or anything that you think is a problem and that isn't under the radar, go ahead and [open a new GitHub issue](https://github.com/GrepTimeTeam/greptimedb/issues/new).
  - In the given templates, look for the one that suits you.
  - If you bump into anything, reach out to our [Slack](https://greptime.com/slack) for a wider audience and ask for help.
- What happens after:
  - Once we spot a new issue, we identify and categorize it as soon as possible.
  - Usually, it gets assigned to other developers. Follow up and see what folks are talking about and how they take care of it.
  - Please be patient and offer as much information as you can to help reach a solution or a consensus. You are not alone and embrace team power.

### Before PR

- To ensure that community is free and confident in its ability to use your contributions, please sign the Contributor License Agreement (CLA) which will be incorporated in the pull request process.
- Make sure all your codes are formatted and follow the [coding style](https://pingcap.github.io/style-guide/rust/).
- Make sure all unit tests are passed.
- Make sure all clippy warnings are fixed (you can check it locally by running `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings -D clippy::print_stdout -D clippy::print_stderr`).

#### `pre-commit` Hooks
You could setup the [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/#plugins) hooks to run these checks on every commit automatically.

1. Install `pre-commit`
```
$ pip install pre-commit
```
or
```
$ brew install pre-commit
```

2. Install the `pre-commit` hooks
```
$ pre-commit install
pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit

$ pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg
pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/commit-msg

$ pre-commit install --hook-type pre-push
pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-pus
```

now `pre-commit` will run automatically on `git commit`.

### Title

The titles of pull requests should be prefixed with category names listed in [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0)
like `feat`/`fix`/`docs`, with a concise summary of code change following. DO NOT use last commit message as pull request title.

### Description

- Feel free to go brief if your pull request is small, like a typo fix.
- But if it contains large code change, make sure to state the motivation/design details of this PR so that reviewers can understand what you're trying to do.
- If the PR contains any breaking change or API change, make sure that is clearly listed in your description.

### Commit Messages

All commit messages SHOULD adhere to the [Conventional Commits specification](https://conventionalcommits.org/).
