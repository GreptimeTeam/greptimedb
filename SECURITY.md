## Reporting a Vulnerability

We place great importance on the security of GreptimeDB code, software, 
and cloud platform. If you come across a security vulnerability in GreptimeDB, 
we kindly request that you inform us immediately. We will thoroughly investigate
all valid reports and make every effort to resolve the issue promptly.

To report any issues or vulnerabilities, please email us at info@greptime.com, rather than 
posting publicly on GitHub. Be sure to provide us with the version identifier as well as details
on how the vulnerability can be exploited.
