## Introduction

**GreptimeDB** is an open-source unified & cost-effective observerability database for **Metrics**, **Logs**, and **Events** (also **Traces** in plan). You can gain real-time insights from Edge to Cloud at Any Scale.

## News

**[GreptimeDB tops JSONBench's billion-record cold run test!](https://greptime.com/blogs/2025-03-18-jsonbench-greptimedb-performance)**

## Why GreptimeDB

Our core developers have been building observerability data platforms for years. Based on our best practices, GreptimeDB was born to give you:

* **Unified Processing of Metrics, Logs, and Events**

  GreptimeDB unifies observerability data processing by treating all data - whether metrics, logs, or events - as timestamped events with context. Users can analyze this data using either [SQL](https://docs.greptime.com/user-guide/query-data/sql) or [PromQL](https://docs.greptime.com/user-guide/query-data/promql) and leverage stream processing ([Flow](https://docs.greptime.com/user-guide/flow-computation/overview)) to enable continuous aggregation. [Read more](https://docs.greptime.com/user-guide/concepts/data-model).

* **Cloud-native Distributed Database**

  Built for [Kubernetes](https://docs.greptime.com/user-guide/deployments/deploy-on-kubernetes/greptimedb-operator-management). GreptimeDB achieves seamless scalability with its [cloud-native architecture](https://docs.greptime.com/user-guide/concepts/architecture) of separated compute and storage, built on object storage (AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, etc.) while enabling cross-cloud deployment through a unified data access layer.

* **Performance and Cost-effective**

  Written in pure Rust for superior performance and reliability. GreptimeDB features a distributed query engine with intelligent indexing to handle high cardinality data efficiently. Its optimized columnar storage achieves 50x cost efficiency on cloud object storage through advanced compression. [Benchmark reports](https://www.greptime.com/blogs/2024-09-09-report-summary).

* **Cloud-Edge Collaboration**

  GreptimeDB seamlessly operates across cloud and edge (ARM/Android/Linux), providing consistent APIs and control plane for unified data management and efficient synchronization. [Learn how to run on Android](https://docs.greptime.com/user-guide/deployments/run-on-android/).

* **Multi-protocol Ingestion, SQL & PromQL Ready**

  Widely adopted database protocols and APIs, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, InfluxDB, OpenTelemetry, Loki and Prometheus, etc.  Effortless Adoption & Seamless Migration. [Supported Protocols Overview](https://docs.greptime.com/user-guide/protocols/overview).

For more detailed info please read  [Why GreptimeDB](https://docs.greptime.com/user-guide/concepts/why-greptimedb).

## Try GreptimeDB

### 1. [Live Demo](https://greptime.com/playground)

Try out the features of GreptimeDB right from your browser.

### 2. [GreptimeCloud](https://console.greptime.cloud/)

Start instantly with a free cluster.

### 3. Docker Image

To install GreptimeDB locally, the recommended way is via Docker:

```shell
docker pull greptime/greptimedb
```

Start a GreptimeDB container with:

```shell
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:4000-4003:4000-4003 \
  -v "$(pwd)/greptimedb:./greptimedb_data" \
  --name greptime --rm \
  greptime/greptimedb:latest standalone start \
  --http-addr 0.0.0.0:4000 \
  --rpc-bind-addr 0.0.0.0:4001 \
  --mysql-addr 0.0.0.0:4002 \
  --postgres-addr 0.0.0.0:4003
```

Access the dashboard via `http://localhost:4000/dashboard`.

## Getting Started

* [Quickstart](https://docs.greptime.com/getting-started/quick-start)
* [User Guide](https://docs.greptime.com/user-guide/overview)
* [Demos](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/demo-scene)
* [FAQ](https://docs.greptime.com/faq-and-others/faq)

## Build

Check the prerequisite:

* [Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (nightly)
* [Protobuf compiler](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/) (>= 3.15)
* C/C++ building essentials, including `gcc`/`g++`/`autoconf` and glibc library (eg. `libc6-dev` on Ubuntu and `glibc-devel` on Fedora)
* Python toolchain (optional): Required only if using some test scripts.

Build GreptimeDB binary:

```shell
make
```

Run a standalone server:

```shell
cargo run -- standalone start
```
