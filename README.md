## Introduction

**GreptimeDB** is an open-source unified time-series database for **Metrics**, **Events**, and **Logs** (also **Traces** in plan). You can gain real-time insights from Edge to Cloud at any scale.

## Why GreptimeDB

Our core developers have been building time-series data platforms for years. Based on our best-practices, GreptimeDB is born to give you:

* **Unified all kinds of time series**

  GreptimeDB treats all time series as contextual events with timestamp, and thus unifies the processing of metrics and events. It supports analyzing metrics and events with SQL and PromQL, and doing streaming with continuous aggregation.

* **Cloud-Edge collaboration**

  GreptimeDB can be deployed on ARM architecture-compatible Android/Linux systems as well as cloud environments from various vendors. Both sides run the same software, providing identical APIs and control planes, so your application can run at the edge or on the cloud without modification, and data synchronization also becomes extremely easy and efficient.

* **Cloud-native distributed database**

  By leveraging object storage (S3 and others), separating compute and storage, scaling stateless compute nodes arbitrarily, GreptimeDB implements seamless scalability. It also supports cross-cloud deployment with a built-in unified data access layer over different object storages.

* **Performance and Cost-effective**

  Flexible indexing capabilities and distributed, parallel-processing query engine, tackling high cardinality issues down. Optimized columnar layout for handling time-series data; compacted, compressed, and stored on various storage backends, particularly cloud object storage with 50x cost efficiency.

* **Compatible with InfluxDB, Prometheus and more protocols**

  Widely adopted database protocols and APIs, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Prometheus Remote Storage, etc. [Read more](https://docs.greptime.com/user-guide/clients/overview).

## Try GreptimeDB

### 1. [GreptimePlay](https://greptime.com/playground)

Try out the features of GreptimeDB right from your browser.

### 2. [GreptimeCloud](https://console.greptime.cloud/)

Start instantly with a free cluster.

### 3. Docker Image

To install GreptimeDB locally, the recommended way is via Docker:

```shell
docker pull greptime/greptimedb
```

Start a GreptimeDB container with:

```shell
docker run --rm --name greptime --net=host greptime/greptimedb standalone start
```

Read more about [Installation](https://docs.greptime.com/getting-started/installation/overview) on docs.

## Getting Started

* [Quickstart](https://docs.greptime.com/getting-started/quick-start/overview)
* [Write Data](https://docs.greptime.com/user-guide/clients/overview)
* [Query Data](https://docs.greptime.com/user-guide/query-data/overview)
* [Operations](https://docs.greptime.com/user-guide/operations/overview)

## Build

Check the prerequisite:

* [Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (nightly)
* [Protobuf compiler](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/) (>= 3.15)
* Python toolchain (optional): Required only if built with PyO3 backend. More detail for compiling with PyO3 can be found in its [documentation](https://pyo3.rs/v0.18.1/building_and_distribution#configuring-the-python-version).

Build GreptimeDB binary:

```shell
make
```

Run a standalone server:

```shell
cargo run -- standalone start
```

## Project Status

The current version has not yet reached General Availability version standards.
In line with our Greptime 2024 Roadmap, we plan to achieve a production-level
version with the update to v1.0 in August. [[Join Force]](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb/issues/3412)
