## Introduction

**GreptimeDB** is an open-source, cloud-native, unified & cost-effective observability database for **Metrics**, **Logs**, and **Traces**. You can gain real-time insights from Edge to Cloud at Any Scale.

## News

**[GreptimeDB tops JSONBench's billion-record cold run test!](https://greptime.com/blogs/2025-03-18-jsonbench-greptimedb-performance)**

## Why GreptimeDB

Our core developers have been building observability data platforms for years. Based on our best practices, GreptimeDB was born to give you:

* **Unified Processing of Observability Data**

  A unified database that treats metrics, logs, and traces as timestamped wide events with context, supporting [SQL](https://docs.greptime.com/user-guide/query-data/sql)/[PromQL](https://docs.greptime.com/user-guide/query-data/promql) queries and [stream processing](https://docs.greptime.com/user-guide/flow-computation/overview) to simplify complex data stacks.

* **High Performance and Cost-effective**

   Written in Rust, combines a distributed query engine with [rich indexing](https://docs.greptime.com/user-guide/manage-data/data-index) (inverted, fulltext, skip data, and vector) and optimized columnar storage to deliver sub-second responses on petabyte-scale data and high-cost efficiency.

* **Cloud-native Distributed Database**

  Built for [Kubernetes](https://docs.greptime.com/user-guide/deployments/deploy-on-kubernetes/greptimedb-operator-management). GreptimeDB achieves seamless scalability with its [cloud-native architecture](https://docs.greptime.com/user-guide/concepts/architecture) of separated compute and storage, built on object storage (AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, etc.) while enabling cross-cloud deployment through a unified data access layer.

* **Developer-Friendly**

  Access standardized SQL/PromQL interfaces through built-in web dashboard, REST API, and MySQL/PostgreSQL protocols. Supports widely adopted data ingestion [protocols](https://docs.greptime.com/user-guide/protocols/overview) for seamless migration and integration.

* **Flexible Deployment Options**

  Deploy GreptimeDB anywhere from ARM-based edge devices to cloud environments with unified APIs and bandwidth-efficient data synchronization. Query edge and cloud data seamlessly through identical APIs. [Learn how to run on Android](https://docs.greptime.com/user-guide/deployments/run-on-android/).

For more detailed info please read  [Why GreptimeDB](https://docs.greptime.com/user-guide/concepts/why-greptimedb).

## Try GreptimeDB

### 1. [Live Demo](https://greptime.com/playground)

Try out the features of GreptimeDB right from your browser.

### 2. [GreptimeCloud](https://console.greptime.cloud/)

Start instantly with a free cluster.

### 3. Docker Image

To install GreptimeDB locally, the recommended way is via Docker:

```shell
docker pull greptime/greptimedb
```

Start a GreptimeDB container with:

```shell
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:4000-4003:4000-4003 \
  -v "$(pwd)/greptimedb:./greptimedb_data" \
  --name greptime --rm \
  greptime/greptimedb:latest standalone start \
  --http-addr 0.0.0.0:4000 \
  --rpc-bind-addr 0.0.0.0:4001 \
  --mysql-addr 0.0.0.0:4002 \
  --postgres-addr 0.0.0.0:4003
```

Access the dashboard via `http://localhost:4000/dashboard`.

## Getting Started

* [Quickstart](https://docs.greptime.com/getting-started/quick-start)
* [User Guide](https://docs.greptime.com/user-guide/overview)
* [Demos](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/demo-scene)
* [FAQ](https://docs.greptime.com/faq-and-others/faq)

## Build

Check the prerequisite:

* [Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (nightly)
* [Protobuf compiler](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/) (>= 3.15)
* C/C++ building essentials, including `gcc`/`g++`/`autoconf` and glibc library (eg. `libc6-dev` on Ubuntu and `glibc-devel` on Fedora)
* Python toolchain (optional): Required only if using some test scripts.

Build GreptimeDB binary:

```shell
make
```

Run a standalone server:

```shell
cargo run -- standalone start
```
