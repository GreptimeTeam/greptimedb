# Luminar Flow

## Summary

This RFC proposes a redesign of the flow architecture where flownode becomes a lightweight in-memory state management node with an embedded frontend for direct computation. This approach optimizes resource utilization and improves scalability by eliminating network hops while maintaining clear separation between coordination and computation tasks.

## Motivation

The current flow architecture has several limitations:

1. **Resource Inefficiency**: Flownodes perform both state management and computation, leading to resource duplication and inefficient utilization.
2. **Scalability Constraints**: Computation resources are tied to flownode instances, limiting horizontal scaling capabilities.
3. **State Management Complexity**: Mixing computation with state management makes the system harder to maintain and debug.
4. **Network Overhead**: Additional network hops between flownode and separate frontend nodes add latency.

The Luminar Flow architecture addresses these issues by:
- Consolidating computation within flownode through embedded frontend
- Eliminating network overhead by removing separate frontend node communication
- Simplifying state management by focusing flownode on its core responsibility
- Improving system scalability and maintainability

## Details

### Architecture Overview

The Luminar Flow architecture transforms flownode into a lightweight coordinator that maintains flow state with an embedded frontend for computation. The key components involved are:

1. **Flownode**: Maintains in-memory state, coordinates computation, and includes an embedded frontend for query execution
2. **Embedded Frontend**: Executes **incremental** computations within the flownode
3. **Datanode**: Stores final results and source data

```

### Core Components

#### 1. Flow State Management

Flownode maintains a state map for each flow:

```rust
type FlowState = Map<Timestamp, (Map<Key, Value>, Sequence)>;
```

Where:
- **Timestamp**: Time window identifier for aggregation groups
- **Key**: Aggregation group expressions (`group_exprs`)
- **Value**: Aggregation expressions results (`aggr_exprs`)
- **Sequence**: Computation progress marker for incremental updates

#### 2. Incremental Computation Process

The computation process follows these steps:

1. **Trigger Evaluation**: Flownode determines when to trigger computation based on:
   - Time intervals (periodic updates)
   - Data volume thresholds
   - Sequence progress requirements

2. **Query Execution**: Flownode executes `__aggr_state` queries using its embedded frontend with:
   - Time window filters
   - Sequence range constraints

3. **State Update**: Flownode receives partial state results and updates its internal state:
   - Merges new values with existing aggregation state
   - Updates sequence markers to track progress
   - Identifies changed time windows for result computation

4. **Result Materialization**: Flownode computes final results using `__aggr_merge` operations:
   - Processes only updated time windows(and time series) for efficiency
   - Writes results back to datanode directly through its embedded frontend

### Detailed Workflow

#### Incremental State Query

```sql
-- Example incremental state query executed by embedded frontend
SELECT
    __aggr_state(avg(value)) as state,
    time_window,
    group_key
FROM source_table
WHERE
    timestamp >= :window_start
    AND timestamp < :window_end
    AND __sequence >= :last_sequence
    AND __sequence < :current_sequence
    -- sequence range is actually written in grpc header, but shown here for clarity
GROUP BY time_window, group_key;
```

#### State Merge Process

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant F as Flownode (Coordinator)
    participant EF as Embedded Frontend (Lightweight)
    participant DN as Datanode (Heavy Computation)
    
    F->>F: Evaluate trigger conditions
    F->>EF: Execute __aggr_state query with sequence range
    EF->>DN: Send query to datanode (Heavy scan & aggregation)
    DN->>DN: Scan data and compute partial aggregation state (Heavy CPU/I/O)
    DN->>EF: Return aggregated state results
    EF->>F: Forward state results (Lightweight merge)
    F->>F: Merge with existing state
    F->>F: Update sequence markers (Lightweight)
    F->>EF: Compute incremental results with __aggr_merge
    EF->>DN: Write incremental results to datanode
```

### Refill Implementation and State Management

#### Refill Process

Refill is implemented as a straightforward `__aggr_state` query with time and sequence constraints:

```sql
-- Refill query for flow state recovery
SELECT 
    __aggr_state(aggregation_functions) as state,
    time_window,
    group_keys
FROM source_table 
WHERE 
    timestamp >= :refill_start_time 
    AND timestamp < :refill_end_time
    AND __sequence >= :start_sequence 
    AND __sequence < :end_sequence
    -- sequence range is actually written in grpc header, but shown here for clarity
GROUP BY time_window, group_keys;
```

#### State Recovery Strategy

1. **Recent Data (Stream Mode)**: For recent time windows, flownode refills state using incremental queries
2. **Historical Data (Batch Mode)**: For older time windows, flownode triggers batch computation directly and no need to refill state
3. **Hybrid Approach**: Combines stream and batch processing based on data age and availability

#### Mirror Write Optimization

Mirror writes are simplified to only transmit timestamps to flownode:

```rust
struct MirrorWrite {
    timestamps: Vec<Timestamp>,
    // Removed: actual data payload
}
```

This optimization:
- Eliminates network overhead by using embedded frontend
- Enables flownode to track pending time windows efficiently
- Allows flownode to decide processing mode (stream vs batch) based on timestamp age

Another optimization could be just send dirty time windows range for each flow to flownode directly, no need to send timestamps one by one.

### Query Optimization Strategies

#### Sequence-Based Incremental Processing

The core optimization relies on sequence-constrained queries:

```sql
-- Optimized incremental query
SELECT __aggr_state(expr) 
FROM table 
WHERE time_range AND sequence_range
```

Benefits:
- **Reduced Scan Volume**: Only processes data since last computation
- **Efficient Resource Usage**: Minimizes CPU and I/O overhead
- **Predictable Performance**: Query cost scales with incremental data size

#### Time Window Partitioning

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Time Windows"
        W1["Window 1<br/>09:00-09:05"]
        W2["Window 2<br/>09:05-09:10"]
        W3["Window 3<br/>09:10-09:15"]
    end
    
    subgraph "Processing Strategy"
        W1 --> Batch["Batch Mode<br/>(Old Data)"]
        W2 --> Stream["Stream Mode<br/>(Recent Data)"]
        W3 --> Stream2["Stream Mode<br/>(Current Data)"]
    end
```

### Performance Characteristics

#### Memory Usage

- **Flownode**: O(active_time_windows Ã— group_cardinality) for state storage
- **Embedded Frontend**: O(query_batch_size) for temporary computation
- **Overall**: Significantly reduced compared to current architecture

#### Computation Distribution

- **Direct Processing**: Queries processed directly within flownode's embedded frontend
- **Fault Tolerance**: Simplified error handling with fewer distributed components
- **Scalability**: Computation capacity scales with flownode instances

#### Network Optimization

- **Reduced Payload**: Mirror writes only contain timestamps
- **Efficient Queries**: Sequence constraints minimize data transfer
- **Result Caching**: State results cached in flownode memory

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

1. **State Management**: Implement in-memory state map in flownode
2. **Query Interface**: Integrate `__aggr_state` query interface in embedded frontend(Already done in previous query pushdown optimizer work)
3. **Basic Coordination**: Implement query dispatch and result collection
4. **Sequence Tracking**: Implement sequence-based incremental processing(Can use similar interface which leader range read use)

After phase 1, the system should support basic flow operations with incremental updates.

### Phase 2: Optimization Features
